     This website is build in raw PHP and VanillaJS.
     It also uses my own PHP MVC REST WTF framework, brilliantly call "Dumb".

     and powerful as a supersayen,
     come makes some $app->kamehameha() together!
     PS: You can also find an attempt of JS VVC framework of my own conception, proudly call "anGGularJS". Still far from the real one') ?>
